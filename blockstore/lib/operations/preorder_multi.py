"""
A note on code organization...
A multi-preorder is still considered to be a kind of preorder;
it's just that all the names it covers have to be registered
in order for any of them to be accepted.  For the sake of avoiding
breaking-consensus changes, we treat a multi-name preorder like 
a 1-name preorder as much as possible:
    * we store multi-preorder data along with the preorder data
    * we use the exact same consensus fields (modulo a slightly longer op-bytecode)

Unlike NAME_TRANSFER (which also comes in two flavors), the logic for building, 
broadcasting, and parsing multi-name preorders is different enough that it warrants
its own file (this one).  However, this code should not be construed as representing
a wholly separate op-code; it's still considered to be part of the NAME_PREORDER 
op-code logic.
